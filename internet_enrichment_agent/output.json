{"statusCode": 200, "body": "Generate architectural design documentation for a read augmented AI solution built on AWS Bedrock. The solution should incorporate an API gateway that receives requests from a front-end via REST API, initiates a step function, and utilizes individual lambdas for each of the following steps:\n\n1. Analyze and clean up the request, transforming it into a prompt for the Bedrock API.\n2. Interact with an in-house API to augment the request with additional details.\n3. Use the Bedrock API to generate a response for the request.\n4. Validate the response and format it according to standardized expectations.\n\nThe Bedrock model encompasses a foundation model and a read-augmented knowledge base.\n\nEnrichment: Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS) is a subsidiary of Amazon that provides on-demand cloud computing platforms and APIs to individuals, companies, and governments, on a metered, pay-as-you-go basis. Clients will often use this in combination with autoscaling. These cloud computing web services provide various services related to networking, compute, storage, middleware, IoT and other processing capacity, as well as software tools via AWS server farms. This frees clients from managing, scaling, and patching hardware and operating systems. \nOne of the foundational services is Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2), which allows users to have at their disposal a virtual cluster of computers, with extremely high availability, which can be interacted with over the internet via REST APIs, a CLI or the AWS console. AWS's virtual computers emulate most of the attributes of a real computer, including hardware central processing units (CPUs) and graphics processing units (GPUs) for processing; local/RAM memory; hard-disk (HDD)/SSD storage; a choice of operating systems; networking; and pre-loaded application software such as web servers, databases, and customer relationship management (CRM).\n\n"}
