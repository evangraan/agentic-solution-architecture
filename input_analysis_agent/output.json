{"statusCode": 200, "body": " PROMPT: Generate architectural design documentation for a read augmented AI solution built on AWS Bedrock. The solution should incorporate an API gateway that receives requests from a front-end via REST API, initiates a step function, and utilizes individual lambdas for each of the following steps:\n\n1. Analyze and clean up the request, transforming it into a prompt for the Bedrock API.\n2. Interact with an in-house API to augment the request with additional details.\n3. Use the Bedrock API to generate a response for the request.\n4. Validate the response and format it according to standardized expectations.\n\nThe Bedrock model encompasses a foundation model and a read-augmented knowledge base.\n\nSEARCH: AWS Bedrock architecture design"}
